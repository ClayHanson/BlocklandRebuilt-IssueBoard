# Blockland Rebuilt Issues Board
This repository holds the public issue board for Blockland Rebuilt.

**Make sure you have already searched if the bug has been reported** before you report it - make sure to search both open and closed posts. Also, adding related labels to your post (white-color only) helps us out too.

There are three main categories for issue types - please use the provided templates to start with.
## Bugs
Found a problem or bug in Rebuilt? After you have searched and found that your bug is unique, use the "Bug Report" template to get started.
- Please ensure you have encountered this bug multiple times or can reproduce it reliably. We can't fix one-off fluke bugs if we cant replicate them.
- Please link any add-ons or saves that are related to the bug, so we can try to replicate the bug ourselves.

## Inconsistencies
These will be far less common, but can still be important for add-on backwards compatibility. Use this template if you have found an aspect of Rebuilt that unintentionally behaves differently to how it did on Retail Blockland.
- Direct comparisons between Rebuilt and Retail are appreciated to really show the difference.
- Feel free to link any add-ons/saves that can greatly help us to see the inconsistency best.

## New Feature
Theres a lot of new potential features that could be implemented into Rebuilt, and we have decided to use this issue board to also track new feature ideas too.
- Most new feature issues will end up being quiet for a long time as we will be slow to implement features into the game.
- Please keep new feature requests realistic. We aren't interested in replacing the entire game engine, and huge complicated features are entire projects of their own.
- Consider the wider appeal of your feature. If the feature only appeals to very few people, a lot of other potential new features will be prioritised instead.
